# weatherApp

Single page weather application

Purpose: Create a SPA weather application that uses an API to provide weather data such as time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and what the weather actually feels like currently when these factors are taken into account.

Additionally, future implementations will be a dynamic color scheme that is reactive to the time of the day and also the type of weather will affect what music playlist is played.
